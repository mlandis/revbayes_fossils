# RevBayes: Analysis of Fossil and Molecular Data

## Instructors: Tracy Heath, Walker Pett, and April Wright

### General Information
This workshop is a 3-hour session, held on January 8, 2017 at the [Society of Systematic Biologists Meeting in Baton Rouge, LA USA](https://ssb2017.github.io/). 

This half-day workshop will guide participants through the theory and practice of combined inference of dated phylogenies using fossil and molecular data. For this workshop, participants should attend the RevBayes Introduction workshop or have previous experience using RevBayes. We will cover the background necessary to understand the fossilized birth-death process, relaxed clock models, and discrete morphological evolution. The tutorial provided will demonstrate how to perform a "total-evidence analysis" on a provided dataset. Additionally, participants can bring their own data to analyze.  

### Travel Awards

[**Apply Here**](https://goo.gl/forms/9OkFAvmw1HApRLOs2)

The travel awards will be $400 each (for reimbursement of travel/registration to the conference) and preference will be given to students, early career scientists, and researchers working with natural history collections data.

To be eligible for an award, you must attend any TWO of the RevBayes workshops held at the SSB meeting. If one of those workshops is not the RevBayes Introduction, you must complete introductory materials that will be sent to you prior to the meeting (or demonstrate sufficient prior experience using RevBayes). 

Support for these travel awards is provided by funds from NSF grant DEB-1556615 (awarded to T. Heath, D. Ksepka, & R. Meredith) and NSF grant DEB-1355071 (J. Brown & R. Thomson)

## Required Background Material

This workshop covers a very complicated analysis that requires the participants to specify complex statistical models. Because of the challenging material, we expect all participants to have some previous experience using RevBayes before attending the workshop. This can be completed in two ways:

1. Attend the Introduction to RevBayes Workshop on Jan. 7 ([https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro))
2. Complete the introductory tutorials that are offered for the [introductory workshop](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro):
	* Basic Introduction to Rev and MCMC ([tutorial PDF](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro/blob/master/tutorials/RB_Basics_Tutorial.pdf))
	* Substitution Models for Time-Constrained Trees ([tutorial pdf](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro/blob/master/tutorials/RB_CTMC_Tutorial.pdf))
	* Partitioned Data Analysis ([tutorial pdf](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro/blob/master/tutorials/RB_Partition_Tutorial.pdf))
	* Model Selection using Bayes Factors ([tutorial pdf](https://github.com/ssb2017/revbayes_intro/blob/master/tutorials/RB_BayesFactor_Tutorial.pdf))


## Install RevBayes

This workshop will use RevBayes v1.X. It can be downloaded from [revbayes.com](http://revbayes.github.io/code.html) for Windows 7 or higher or for Mac OSX 10.6 or higher. For Unix systems, you can clone the source code from [https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes).

## Install Accessory Programs

The RevBayes workshops will also use additional for analysis of output and summarization of the MCMC. Please download and install the following:

* Tracer ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/))
* FigTree ([http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/))
